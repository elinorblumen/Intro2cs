==================

a. A simple program to convert number of spoons to number of cups based on a given ratio.
b. Calculates a basic mathematical expression (add, subtract, multiply, divide). also contains a function
   that receives a string from the user describing such expression and feeds it to the calculating function.
c. Finds the largest and smallest numbers among a set of three numbers
d. Solve a given quadratic equation. also contains a function for user input of the equation and output
   of the solutions to the standard output.
e. Calculate the area of a given shape (circle, rectangle, trapezoid) based on user input of the shape and dimensions.
f. Check whether at least two out of three temperatures have exceeded a certain threshold.
