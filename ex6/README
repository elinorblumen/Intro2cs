This exercise consists of ten main functions:


a. print_to_n
b. print_reversed
c. is_prime
d. divisors
e. exp_n_x
f. play_hanoi
g. print_binary_sequences
h. print_sequences
i. print_no_repetition_sequences
j. no_repetition_sequences_list

==================


a. Function meant to receive an integer n and print all integers from 1 to n
   in increasing order.

b. Function meant to receive an integer n and print all integers from n to 1 in
   decreasing order.

c. Function meant to receive an integer n and return True if n is a prime number
   and False otherwise.

d. Function meant to receive an integer n and return a list of all numbers from 1 to
   n's absolute value that divide n.

e. Function receives a non-negative int n and a reel number x
   and returns the exponential sum of x with relation to n.

f. Function receives given number of discs, definition of source pole, destination pole,
   and temporary pole. and solves the 'Game of Hanoi' for the given parameters.

g. Function meant to receive a non negative integer n and print all
   possible sequences of 0's and 1's who's length equals n.

h. Function receives a list of characters and a non negative integer
   and prints all possible combinations of characters from the list,
   who's length is equals n.
   Functions uses 'print_sequences_with_prefix' function.

i. Function receives a list of characters and an integer n and prints
   all possible sequences of letters from the the list who's length
   equals n and in which non of the characters repeats itself.

j. Function meant to receive a list of characters and a non-negative integer n
   and return a list of all possible sequences of characters from the list who's
   length equals n and non of the characters repeats itself.
